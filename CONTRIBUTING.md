### Contributing to message-catalog-manager

We welcome contributions to the message-catalog-manager Project in many forms, and there's always plenty to do!

First things first, please review the message-catalog-manager Project's [Code of Conduct](CONDUCT.md) before participating. It is important that we keep things civil.

### Legal stuff
We have tried to make it as easy as possible to make contributions. This applies to how we handle the legal aspects of contribution. We use the same approach&mdash;the [Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO)](DCO1.1.txt)&mdash;that the Linux&reg; Kernel [community](http://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin) uses to manage code contributions.
We simply ask that when submitting a pull request, the developer must include a sign-off statement in the pull request description.

Here is an example Signed-off-by line, which indicates that the submitter accepts the DCO:

```
Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@hisdomain.com>
```
